                        ABOUT TGC: TGC Technology has one goal. Honest IT that is  accesable to as many people as possible, unlike many other more commericial IT service providers I actually enjoy providing technical support and getting payed it just a bonus! I will never try to push unnessasary services nor try to upsell you on a new PC. I only perferm repairs once I am sure of the problem and have figured out the best course of action and will never charge you for failed repairs. </p> ABOUT ME:

 Hello, I am Toby a student at DHS  with a pation about technology, for me being able to work with technology and get paid while doing it is a dream come true. Ever since I can remember finding out how things work has been a goal of mine, and computers which are one of the ultimate feats of human engineering, have always been especially interesting. When I was in kindergarten my mom's iBook seemed like magic. Now I have built my own computer and have a much deeper understanding of how computers work, I know how to code in Java, Python and C++, I enjoy using Arduino and Raspberry Pi. I also know how to build a website and creates model in CAD. I am always seeking to learn more and constently building my skills.
