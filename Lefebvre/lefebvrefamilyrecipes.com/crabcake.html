	Carefully clean the crabmeat of all shell fragments but do not crumble the lumps of crabs themselves.<BR><BR>
Cut the sweet pepper in half remove the seeds. Cut the pepper into a small dice, sauté in 1 teaspoon olive oil and set aside. Chop the garlic cloves into a fine dice or crush them in a garlic press. Clean the jalapeno peppers of their seed and dice these finely. (Be sure to wash your hands well after handling chilli pepper ad their juices can be quite irritating to your skin and eyes.)<BR><BR>
Mix the crabmeat with the sweet peppers, garlic, jalapeno the chopped cilantro leaves and the mayonnaise. Add the seasoning powder, salt and peppers and refrigerate 20 minutes before continuing. <BR><BR>
Using an ice cream scooper, from eight equal size balls and using the palms of your hand, pat them into a puck. This is the basic form of the crab cake. Sprinkle the reserved bread crumbs onto your work surface and press the cakes into this one at a time to coat evenly on all sides. Chill the crab cakes for at least 4 hours.<BR><BR>
Heat the olive oil in a sauté pan until just before it begins to smoke. Add crab cakes. When they are browed on both sides remove from pan
