							<h1>More About Me!</h1>
							<p>Toby Cowles is a high school student in Darien and swimmer for CPAC. He is a self-taught Electronic Hobbyist, 3D Printing Enthusiast, and amateur sysadmin who also dabbles in Android development/hacking and web design. Some of his recent projects include the TGC Big 3D printer v1, a 400x400x400mm RepRap machine that is currently about 3/4 of the way finished. He has also built 
An opensource automated Arduino 18650 battery capacity tester, so that you never get scammed by fake Chinese battery cells. (https://github.com/TGC-TECH/ArduinoBatTest) He created A video microscope for SMD soldering using an old point and shoot, a linear rod from a trash picked HP printer, a magnifying glass, and some 3D printed bits.
and finally, he has designed A 3D printed raspberry pi laptop. Toby runs a proxmox VE Linux server which allows him to host some of his websites (but he mostly host them through GitHub because he can’t rival their uptime) as well as create a print server, media server,  Minecraft server, imessage/wemessage server, remote windows PC, and NAS. Toby's experience includes teaching classes at the rippowam labs makerspace, FCA, and Darien Library, as well as programming in many languages. As an electronic hobbyist Toby has experience soldering, working with Arduino and Raspberry Pi, and troubleshooting basic circuits including using a multimeter and an ocliscope. Toby also has experience as a system admistrator and IT from DHS iTeam, TGC Technology, and managing his home server and network. He also happens to be a certified lifegaurd and competive swimmer. If you would like to contact Toby you can reach him via email <a href="mailto:tobycowles1015@gmail.com">at tobycowles1015@gmail.com</a> or by phone at 203-802-7342, or you can find him online at anywhere listed at the homepage or at <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/TGC_TECH/designs"> Thingiverse  </p>
